# IITC Advanced Route Planner Plugin

## Overview
The Advanced Route Planner is a plugin for IITC (Ingress Intel Total Conversion) that helps Ingress players plan efficient routes between locations while maximizing gameplay objectives. It provides route optimization, AP/XM calculations, and time estimates for different play styles.

## Features
- **Route Planning**: Plan routes between any two locations with portal waypoints
- **Multiple Optimization Strategies**:
  - Distance-based optimization for shortest routes
  - AP-based optimization for maximum gameplay rewards
  - XM-based optimization for sustainable farming
- **Play Style Support**:
  - Quick Hack: Fast portal interactions
  - Full Deploy: Complete portal capture and deployment
  - Field Building: Optimal field creation strategies
- **Travel Modes**:
  - Walking (5 km/h)
  - Biking (15 km/h)
  - Driving (30 km/h)
- **Advanced Calculations**:
  - AP potential per portal
  - XM costs and gains
  - Time estimates including travel and interaction times
  - Route difficulty based on terrain

## Installation
1. Install IITC if you haven't already (visit [IITC-CE](https://iitc.app/))
2. Install this plugin by either:
   - Adding it through the IITC-CE plugin repository
   - Manually installing the `.user.js` file:
     1. Copy the `.user.js` file to your userscripts folder
     2. Enable it in your userscript manager (e.g., Tampermonkey)
     3. Refresh your IITC page

## Usage
1. Click the route planner icon (üìç) in the IITC toolbar
2. Enter start and end locations (addresses or coordinates)
3. Configure your preferences:
   - Search radius around route
   - Play style (Quick/Full/Fields)
   - Travel mode (Walking/Biking/Driving)
   - Route optimization strategy (Distance/AP/XM)
4. Click "Find Portals" to generate your route
5. Review the suggested route and statistics
6. Optionally adjust settings and regenerate the route

## Configuration
The plugin includes several configurable constants that can be adjusted:

### Time Estimates (in seconds)
```javascript
TIME_ESTIMATES: {
    QUICK_HACK: 15,
    GLYPH_HACK: 45,
    FULL_DEPLOY: 90,
    FIELD_DEPLOY: 120,
    WALKING_SPEED: 1.4,  // meters per second
    BIKING_SPEED: 4.2,   // meters per second
    DRIVING_SPEED: 8.3,  // meters per second
    STOP_TIME: {
        TRAFFIC_LIGHT: 30,
        PARKING: 60,
        COOLDOWN: 300    // hack cooldown
    }
}
```

### AP Values
```javascript
AP_VALUES: {
    DEPLOY_RESONATOR: 125,
    DEPLOY_FIRST: 500,
    DEPLOY_LAST: 250,
    CREATE_LINK: 313,
    CREATE_FIELD: 1250,
    HACK_ENEMY: 100,
    DESTROY_RESONATOR: 75,
    DESTROY_LINK: 187,
    DESTROY_FIELD: 750,
    UPGRADE_RESONATOR: 65
}
```

### XM Values
```javascript
XM_VALUES: {
    DEPLOY_COST: 50,
    HACK_GAIN: 100,
    GLYPH_HACK_GAIN: 250,
    RECYCLE_GAIN: 80,
    MAX_XM: {
        L1: 3000,
        L8: 10000,
        L16: 20000
    }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Route Optimization Strategies

#### Distance Optimization
- Uses nearest neighbor algorithm to minimize total travel distance
- Considers portal density and accessibility
- Optimizes for efficient movement between portals

#### AP Optimization
- Prioritizes portals with high AP potential
- Considers:
  - Uncaptured portals
  - Link/field opportunities
  - Upgrade potential
  - Enemy portal takedown value

#### XM Optimization
- Ensures sustainable XM levels throughout the route
- Balances XM costs with gains
- Prioritizes efficient XM usage while maintaining gameplay objectives

### Portal Analysis
The plugin provides detailed portal analysis including:
- AP potential breakdown
- XM cost/gain calculations
- Link/field opportunities
- Time estimates for different interaction types

## Dependencies
- IITC-CE
- Turf.js (automatically loaded by the plugin)
- Leaflet (provided by IITC)

## Known Issues
- Elevation data requires external API integration (currently returns mock data)
- Traffic and obstacle detection requires additional data sources
- Route optimization may take longer for routes with many portals
